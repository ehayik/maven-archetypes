# Spring Boot Template

A comprehensive skeleton for a Spring Boot application, featuring robust defaults for seamless development.
It includes built-in support for Lombok to minimize boilerplate code, standardized code formatting for consistent code
quality, sophisticated testing mechanisms for robust software quality, and advanced programming error detection to
prevent common pitfalls. This archetype is designed to boost your productivity and enhance code quality in
Spring Boot-based projects.

## Technologies Used

This project uses a number of technologies and libraries:

- **Java JDK 21**: The latest version of Java Development Kit is used for implementing the application logic.
- **Spring Boot**: An open source Java-based framework used to create a Micro Service. It is developed by Pivotal Team.
- **Maven**: A software project management and comprehension tool used primarily for Java projects.
- **Spotless**: A general-purpose formatting plugin that can be used to enforce code style and formatting rules.
- **Palantir**: A modern, lambda-friendly, 120 character Java formatter.
- **Error Prone**: A library to assists Java developers in detecting and fixing common programming mistakes during the compilation phase.
- **NullAway**: A tool to help eliminate _NullPointerException_ (NPE) in your Java code.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you continue, please ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed Java SDK version 21.
- You have a basic understanding of Java, and Spring Boot.
- You have installed an IDE that supports Java and Spring Boot applications development, such as IntelliJ IDEA

### Installing Dependencies

1. Open the project folder.
2. Run `mvn clean compile` to install the necessary dependencies from the POM file.

### Running locally

1. Run `mvn spring-boot:run`

### Testing

In our application, we use different types of tests to ensure code quality:

- Unit tests for testing individual components in isolation.
- Integration tests for testing the interaction between components.
- System tests for testing the application as a whole, in an environment that mimics production.

Here's how you can run them:

- **All Tests (Unit, Integration & System tests):** Use the command `mvn verify`.
- **Unit Tests only:** Use the command `mvn verify -DskipITs`.
- **To skip Integration tests:** Use the command `mvn verify -Dintegration-test.skip=true`.
- **To skip System tests:** Use the command `mvn verify -Dsystem-test.skip=true`.

These commands can either be run in the terminal or in the IntelliJ "Run Anything" dialog (accessed by pressing `Ctrl` twice).

>**NOTE**:
> Typically, integration & system tests take more time to run so you might want to exclude them during development and
> run only before checking in the code.

We strongly recommend running these tests as you develop and not just before the commit, as this might help catch issues
early on.

#### Aggregated Unit, Integration & System Tests Coverage Report

In the context of this project, the [JaCoCo plugin](https://www.jacoco.org/jacoco/trunk/doc/maven.html) is configured to
automatically generate unit, integration & system test coverage reports whenever the tests are run. This means you don't
need to execute any additional commands to create these reports. The reports are saved with the following names:

- **Unit tests:** `jacoco-unit-tests`
- **Integration & System tests:** `jacoco-integration-tests`
- **Merged Report:** `merged`

Furhtermore, These reports can be found in your project's target directory (for example, `target/site/jacoco`) after
running the tests. You can open them with any web browser to view the test coverage in detail.

Addtionally, for those who are interested in a more in-depth understanding of how to report aggregated unit and integration
test coverage with JaCoCo, you might find this [article](https://natritmeyer.com/howto/reporting-aggregated-unit-and-integration-test-coverage-with-jacoco/)
useful. It's not a requirement but a recommended read for a deeper comprehension.

### Code Formatting

The project follows the automatic code formatting approach to reduce 'nit' comments in code reviews, allowing engineers to
focus on the important logic rather than  [bikeshedding](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bikeshedding) about whitespace
or spending time checking if there is any unused import.

The configured code standard is [Palantir Java Format](https://github.com/palantir/palantir-java-format). Its rules are
enforced on each Maven build, via _spotless-maven-plugin_.

>**NOTE**
> Palantir Java Format is  [optimized for code reviews](https://github.com/palantir/palantir-java-format#optimised-for-code-review)

#### How to ensure that every new commit is formatted properly?

This process is automated using a git pre-commit script. Installing `scripts/pre-commit` script file is as simple as putting
a file named pre-commit into the `.git/hooks` folder. This process is fully automated using _maven-resources-plugin_.

The pre-commit script wonâ€™t work if Maven is not installed. The [installation](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
of Apache Maven is a simple process of extracting the archive and adding the `bin` directory with the `mvn` command to
the `PATH`.

#### How to disable the automatic formatter for a part of a file?

The formatter is not as clever as humans are, so it can sometimes produce less readable code, this is where disabling
the automatic formatter comes handy, to retain custom formatting in favor of readability.

```java
// spotless:off
/*
* Java comment
* that must not be reformatted.
*/
// spotless:on
```
