# (WIP) Maven Archetypes

## Description

Maven archetypes intended for more efficient project management. They're designed to assist _my future self_ in quickly 
bootstrapping new projects in alignment with the best industry practices that I've learned over my career. Their aim is 
to simplify setting up a new project by providing templates with an established directory layout and sensible defaults,
thus reducing the time and effort required to get the project up and running.
